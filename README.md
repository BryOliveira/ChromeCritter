ChromeCritter

## Summary
This was a hackathon project for 2021's MoCoHacks, a Montgomery County-wide hackathon, intended to increase productivity by having a tamagotchi style pet that you take care of through checking off your to-do list. 
The intent was to make the project a usable Chrome Extension meaning it needed to work with the ChromeAPI limiting a lot of the JavaScript possible. 
Due to the limitations, perseverance, and ambitious scope of the project we were awarded the Best Beginner Hack Award of 2021.
